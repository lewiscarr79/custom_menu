<h1>About</h1>
Custom Menu is a simple block for Moodle that adds a responsive custom (horizontal) menu to Moodle as a block, with colour settings. This is for when you need a unique secondary menu for a specific course or page.

<h1>Installation</h1>
Copy it to your Moodle "/blocks" folder to install it.
Or install via this Git Repo
Or install via the plugin uploads directly from within Moodle

<h2>License</h2>
As this plugin is built for Moodle, it is provided freely as open-source software under version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

<h2>Version Compatability</h2>
Build for Moodle 4.3+ (but it should work in future versions also)

<h2>Warranty and Support</h2>
This plugin was a concept plugin for a new project. I may not have time to support and maintain it. So, if you use it, bear this in mind. Also, if you fork it and modify it. Then that's also fine.
